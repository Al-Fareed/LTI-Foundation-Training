/*
 * One day, Mahirl is interested in finding how to sort a sequence of integers a1, a2, ... an in non-decreasing order.
Being a young kid, the only operation she can perform is a unit shift. That is, she can move the last element of the sequence to its beginning:
a1, a2, ..., an → an, a1, a2, ..., an - 1.
Help Mahirl to calculate: What is the minimum number of operations that she needs to sort the sequence?
Input and Output Format:
The first line contains an integer, n (2 ≤ n ≤ 105).
The second line contains n integer numbers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 105).
If it's impossible to sort the sequence output -1. Otherwise output the minimum number of operations Mahirl needs to sort it.
Sample Input 1
2
2 1
Sample Output 1
1
Sample Input 2
3
1 3 2
Sample Output 2
