Characteristics Of Algorithm:

Clear and Unambigous-The logic presentation shuold be clear no doubt must occur

Well-Defined inputs-The inputs must be definede correctly, it helps us to get the right results

Well-Defined Outputs-

Feasible-it must optimized and applicable or convenient way

Language Independent-It must be able to write in any lang C,JAVA...

Effectiveness-Following the aboce points to get the effective program



Basic Properties of Algorithm:
It should 

	terminate after a finite time.

	produce at least one output
	take zero or more input

	be deerministic means giving the same output for the same input

Every step in the algorithm must be effective


How to design an algorithm:

Clear problem definition

constraints of the problem must be considered while solving the problem
//constraints in the sense- inputs,arguement s type of variable so on

The input to be taken to solve the problem is solved 

The solution to this problem, is within the given constraints


Design of algo

Algorithmn to add 3 numbers and pront the sum

*START
*Declare 3 integer variable num1,num2 and num3
*Take the three numbers to be added as inputs in variables num1,num2,and num3 respectively
*Declare an integer variable sum to store
the resultant sum of the 3 numbers
*Add the 3 numbers and store the result in the variable sum
*Print the value of the variable sum
*END


PSEUDO CODE:
*A compact and informal high level description of a computer programming algorithm

*It is mandatory that allows the programmer to represent the implementation of algorithm

Flow Chart:
Flowchart is graphical representation of an algorithm
program planning tool to solve as a problem

Rules for flow chart
1-opening statement must be start
2-ending statement must be end
3-All symbols must be connected with arrow line
4-The decision sybmol in the flowchart cannot be associated with the arrow line
